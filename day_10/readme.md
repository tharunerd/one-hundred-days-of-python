# Day 10: Calculator ‚Äì 100 Days of Code (Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu)

This project is part of **Day 10** of the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.

## üéØ Project Overview

Build a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations using functions and loops. The program allows users to continue calculations with the result or start a new one.

## üß† Concepts Covered

- Function definitions and usage
- Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Loops and control flow
- User input and interaction
- Recursive function calls

## üìù Project Description

The calculator supports the following operations:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

Users can:

- Enter two numbers and choose an operation
- View the result
- Continue calculations using the result
- Start a new calculation from scratch

## üíª How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Run the script using Python 3:

```bash
python main.py
