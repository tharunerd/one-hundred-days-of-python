**Day 20 and Day 21** of your 100 Days of Python Bootcamp project — the **Snake Game**:

# 🐍 Snake Game in Python

## 📘 Overview
As a 2000s kid, I was mesmerized by Nokia’s classic Snake game.  
On Day 20 and Day 21 of the 100 Days of Python Bootcamp, I recreated this nostalgic game using **Python** and the **Turtle Graphics** module, applying core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

## 🚀 Features
- Built entirely with Python and the `turtle` module
- Smooth snake movement with keyboard controls
- Collision detection:
  - With walls
  - With food
  - With itself
- Dynamic scoreboard to track progress
- Modular code structure using OOP

## 🧠 Concepts Applied
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, methods, attributes)
- Event-driven programming with keyboard listeners
- Game loop and screen updates
- Collision logic and boundary conditions
- Score tracking and UI updates

## 🛠️ Steps to Build
1. Import the `turtle` graphics module
2. Create the snake body using square segments
3. Implement movement logic and direction controls
4. Add food that appears randomly on the screen
5. Detect collisions:
   - With walls (game over)
   - With food (grow snake and increase score)
   - With itself (game over)
6. Maintain and update the scoreboard

## 🧾 How to Run the Game
Follow these simple steps to run the Snake Game on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
https://github.com/tharunerd/one-hundred-days-of-python.git

cd day_20,21
```

### 2. Run the Game
```bash
python main.py
```

> Make sure you have Python installed and the `turtle` module available (it's built-in with standard Python distributions).

## 🎮 Controls
- Arrow keys to move the snake: ↑ ↓ ← →
- Avoid hitting the walls or yourself
- Eat the food to grow and increase your score

## 🙌 Reflections
This project was a fun and rewarding way to practice OOP in Python.  
It helped me understand how game logic works and how to structure code for interactive applications.
