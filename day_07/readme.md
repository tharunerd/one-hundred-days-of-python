# Day 7: Hangman Game (Part 1) – 100 Days of Code (Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu)

This project is part of **Day 7** of the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build the foundational logic for the classic **Hangman** game using Python. This is the first part of a multi-day project where the game is developed incrementally.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Lists and indexing
- For loops and iteration
- Conditional logic
- String and list manipulation
- Game logic and user interaction

## 📝 Project Description

The goal is to create a basic version of the Hangman game where:

- A word is chosen randomly from a list.
- The player guesses letters one at a time.
- Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word.
- Incorrect guesses are tracked and displayed.
- The game continues until the word is guessed or the player runs out of attempts.

## 💡 Key Features

- Use of lists to represent the hidden word and guessed letters.
- Looping through the word to check for matches.
- Displaying the current state of the word with underscores and revealed letters.
- ASCII art for visual feedback (to be added in later parts).
