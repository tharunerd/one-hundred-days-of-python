# Day 3 - Control Flow & Logical Operators 🔀

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Conditional statements:
  - `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Comparison operators:
  - `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Logical operators:
  - `and`, `or`, `not`
- Nested if statements
- Multiple if statements in succession
- Modulo operator `%` for checking divisibility
- Understanding code indentation and blocks

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### ✅ Conditional Logic
```python
age = 18
if age > 18:
    print("You can drive.")
else:
    print("You cannot drive.")


### 🎯 Final Mini Project: Treasure Island Adventure 🏝️

🗺️ Description:
Build a simple text-based adventure game using nested if/else logic. Player must make a series of decisions to find the treasure or die trying.

🧩 Sample Flow:
First choice: left or right

Then: swim or wait

Then: choose a door (red, yellow, blue)

✅ Key Takeaways

Conditional logic is the backbone of decision-making in programs.

Use and, or, not to combine multiple conditions.

Proper indentation is essential for logical flow in Python.

Games like "Treasure Island" demonstrate how conditionals form the logic of interactive experiences.
