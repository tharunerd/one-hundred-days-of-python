# Day 8: Caesar Cipher – 100 Days of Code (Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu)

This project is part of **Day 8** of the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build a Caesar Cipher program that allows users to encode and decode messages using a shift cipher. The program supports repeated use and handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as non-alphabetic characters.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- String manipulation
- ASCII character encoding
- Modular arithmetic
- Loops and user interaction
- Conditional logic

## 📝 Project Description

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### Features:

- Encode and decode messages
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., punctuation, spaces)
- Allows repeated use until the user chooses to exit

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Run the script using Python 3:

```bash
python main.py
