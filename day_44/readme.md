# 🌟 Day 44: Motivational Poster Website

## 📖 Overview
On **Day 44** of Angela Yu’s *100 Days of Python* course, I stepped into the world of **Web Development**.  
This project is a **Motivational Poster Website** that helped me understand the **foundations of web development** — mainly **HTML** and **CSS**.  

The focus was less on Python and more on how the web works:
- Structuring pages with **HTML**
- Styling them with **CSS**
- Combining both to create a simple but attractive motivational poster.

## ✨ Features
- 🖼️ A motivational poster layout (image + quote + author).
- 🎨 Styled with CSS to improve presentation.
- 🌍 Pure **HTML & CSS** — no frameworks or JS required.
- 💡 Beginner-friendly project that shows how web pages are built from scratch.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** → to structure the content.
- **CSS3** → to style and format the poster.
