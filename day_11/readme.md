# Day 11: Blackjack Game – 100 Days of Code (Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu)

This project is part of **Day 11** of the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Create a simplified version of the classic card game **Blackjack** using Python. The game simulates a match between the user and the computer (dealer), focusing on core programming concepts.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Functions and return values
- Lists and random selection
- Conditional logic and comparison
- Loops and game state control
- Handling edge cases (Blackjack, bust, Ace value)

## 📝 Game Description

The Blackjack game includes the following features:

- Both the user and the computer are dealt two cards initially.
- The user can choose to draw more cards (`hit`) or pass (`stand`).
- The computer draws cards until its score reaches at least 17.
- The game handles special rules like Blackjack (21) and bust (over 21).
- The winner is determined based on the final scores.

## 💡 Key Features

- Score calculation with special handling for Aces (1 or 11)
- Game loop allowing repeated play
- Clear output messages for each game state
- Modular code using functions for clarity and reuse

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Run the script using Python 3:

```bash
python main.py
