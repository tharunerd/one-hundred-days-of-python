# Day 9: Secret Auction – 100 Days of Code (Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu)

This project is part of **Day 9** of the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build a **Secret Auction** program where multiple users can place bids anonymously. After all bids are collected, the program determines and announces the highest bidder.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Dictionaries for storing user bids
- Loops for collecting multiple entries
- Functions for determining the highest bid
- User input and control flow
- Clearing the screen between entries (optional for terminal clarity)

## 📝 Project Description

The program allows users to:

1. Enter their name and bid amount.
2. Continue entering bids until no more users want to participate.
3. Reveal the highest bidder and their bid at the end.

### Features:

- Stores bids using a dictionary (`{name: bid}`)
- Uses a loop to collect multiple bids
- Defines a function to find the highest bidder
- Optionally clears the screen between entries for secrecy

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Run the script using Python 3:

```bash
python main.py
