# 🎮 Day 4 - Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (Python)

## 📌 Project Description

On Day 4 of the Python 100 Days Bootcamp, I built a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game. This is a classic game where a user competes against the computer.

The project helped me understand:
- Python Lists
- Random module
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Indexing
- User input handling

## 🛠 Features

- User can input their choice (0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors)
- Computer randomly selects a move
- Game logic determines who wins
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
- ASCII art for better UX
