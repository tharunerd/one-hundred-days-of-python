Welcome to **Day 43** of Angela Yu’s *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp*.
This day introduces **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** — the backbone of web design. You’ll learn how to transform a plain HTML page into something **visually engaging** with the power of CSS.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

* ✅ What **CSS** is and why it’s essential for styling websites.
* ✅ How to use **selectors** (element, class, ID).
* ✅ Applying styles: **colors, fonts, margins, padding, borders**.
* ✅ Difference between **inline, internal, and external CSS**.
* ✅ Writing clean, maintainable CSS in a separate `styles.css` file.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** → for structuring the webpage.
* **CSS3** → for styling and presentation.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:


2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This project is the **foundation of web design**. By separating **content (HTML)** from **style (CSS)**, you learn how to:

* Build visually appealing web pages.
* Keep code **clean, reusable, and scalable**.
* Prepare for **responsive design** and modern layouts (coming in later days 🚀).

## 📌 Next Step

On **Day 44**, you’ll explore **Intermediate CSS** → positioning, flexbox, and advanced selectors to create more complex, responsive layouts.
